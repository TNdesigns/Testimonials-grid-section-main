            <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company l joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h3>
            <p class="desc">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
                intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly there after. The next 12
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                successfullv switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR start up."</p>

                virtually no coding skills. I now work
                as a mobile engineer for a big
                company. This was one of the best

            <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
            <p class="desc">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can helo me learn programminc
                step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. Int
                disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to walt long for ance. The agile team project, In particular. was outstandina. It took my learning to the next level in a wave
                that no tutorlal could ever have. In fact I've otton ratorron to it during Interviews as an exam developent experience. It certainl helped me land a iob as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>

            <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
                their experiences was easy.</h3>
            <p class="desc">"The staff seemded genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present 
                myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
